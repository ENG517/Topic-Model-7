# Plain Language Report Reddick/Young

## Typography
<p> The typography design decisions were informed by the existing documentation on the subject. The fonts (our chosen fonts were Georgia and Cambria) were professional. The goal was to match the professional tone of our material and the serious nature of the subject, while still being aesthetically pleasing. Our font sizing followed very traditional guidelines with our body font being 14pt, which is slightly easier to read than the classic 12pt font. </p>

<p> The color scheme was chosen to fit the same scheme as the USCIS (United States Citizenship & Immigration Services) in keeping with convention. Our line spacing choices were also convention. The goal of the styling was to maintain a professional tone and to fit in with the existing standards for related materials. </p>

## Organization
<p> One of the challenges with organizing this project is how specific and particular the information is, because there is very little variation of what is and is not acceptable. So while there are some instances where it may feel like the paragraph can be tightened up, it can’t be because the details that would be omitted are important to the final product. The difference between a “novice” rendering of the procedure and an “expert” rendering is the inclusion of basic steps that too an experienced user would be common sense, for example: </p>

<p> The language was simplified between the original project and the final product. The original product was written with a novice audience and standard stylistic conventions in mind. It was written like an article rather than as a topic model. </p>

<p> Above is a screenshot of one of the original markdown project files. Bits and pieces of this information found its way into our dita project, but most of the content was sheared down to its most basic elements. Repetitive elements such as the note regarding the maximum amount of time the visa could allow, which showed up in the introduction and as an alert, were removed for brevity. </p>

## Writing Choices
<p> In line with Lanham’s modified paramedic method, the verb was put at the beginning of the sentence in instances where that made sense. Additionally the imperative form (commands) was used consistently. Using the imperative allowed us to give instructions in a straightforward way. There were some changes made to content to further adhere to the paramedic method </p>

##### **Example #1**
<p>
Location: c_what_is_H-1B_petition.dita
Original: specialty occupations requires the application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent.
Edited: attaining a bachelor’s degree or equivalent and having highly specialized knowledge is required.
Reasoning: Part of the sentence contains repetition from the paragraph above it, the revision also tightens the word count and shifts the verb to the beginning of the sentence.
</p>

##### **Example #2**
<p>
Location: c_the_labor_condition_application.dita
Original: it demonstrates that the proposed job by the sponsoring company could not be filled by any us applicants and therefore, the company needed to look internationally to fill the position
Edited:  demonstrates the job could not be filled by any us applicants and the company needed to hire internationally
Reasoning: shortened for clarity following the paramedic method
</p>

##### **Example #3**
<p>
Location: c_what_is_USCIS_cover_letter.dita
Original: The cover letter also lets the USCIS officer to know where to expect copies of original documents like the clients passport or the offer letter for the job provided by the sponsoring company
Edited: The cover letter directs the USCIS officer to copies of original documents
Reasoning: shortened for clarity and brevity, decision was made that there was no need to mention examples of the documents as that information is included elsewhere.
</p>

<p> By plainlanguage.gov standards, this project highlights two of their guidelines well - the use of topic sentences and use of lists. The shortdesc element functioned as our topic sentences, which were rarely longer than a line long and cut straight to the main subject of the file. </p>
