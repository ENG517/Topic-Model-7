# Procedure Guide for Creating a H-1B Petition

## Introduction to Procedure

A H-1B is a type of visa that aims to enable foreign nationals who have specialized knowledge to enter the U.S. for a period of three years with the possibility of extending that time an additional three years for a total of six years within the U.S. This visa is part of the larger petition it falls under, the I-129 petition. The H-1B visa is just one of many visa types that falls under this petition and it can be a complex process from the time of starting the visa application to filing it with the USCIS. This guide aims to help you do the following steps: 

* Compile the Required Documents for the Visa Application
* Draft a Company Support Letter for the Sponsoring Company
* Draft a USCIS Cover Letter to Better Help USCIS Agents Navigate Your Petition
* Organize the Petition Appropriately to Aid the Reviewing Attorney

#### Steps Not Covered in Guide


* Drafting Official G-28 and I-129 Petition Forms


By the end of this guide you will possess the knowledge to produce an exceptional first draft for a H-1B petition. By following the core concepts of these steps, your reviewing attorney should have a quick turn around between revising your draft and filing the petition on their own. 

**DISCLAIMER**: Drafting official petition forms is commonly done by your attorney or paralegal, it is not advised for legal assistants to draft official petition forms if they have not completed a petition in full prior to reading this guide.

**NOTE**: The H-1B visa is a temporary, non-immigrant visa, the client will only be allowed to stay on this visa status for a maximum of **six** years.

**Assumed Knowledge:** 
* Working knowledge of how to operate a computer, word processor, and email software.
* Working knowledge of your firm's case manager software (INSZoom, LollyLaw, Filevine, etc.)
* Brief knowledge of the [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/) website.
* Brief knowledge of common immigration law documents and terms (Beneficiary, I-94, EAD, etc.)


### Compiling Required Documents 

Since a H-1B visa is employment-based, the documents you will be collecting will be from both the client and the company who is sponsoring the client. Take a look at this USCIS guide that will help you know what the documents you collect need to specifically prove. We have included examples of specific documents as well.
