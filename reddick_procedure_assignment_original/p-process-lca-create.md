## Creating a Labor Condition Application (LCA)
A Labor Condition Application is an application that is often filed concurrently with employment-based petitions to USCIS. It establishes an appropriate wage amount and wage level for a foreign client being sponsored by a company to come work in the U.S. It functions as a safeguard against financial injustices potentially being committed by companies exploiting foreign labor. It is also a useful resource to help sponsoring companies realize the cost of fully sponsoring an employee before committing to other costs such as filing fees. This guide will provide the necessary steps and resources to enable you to find the LCA application and create a draft ready for review by a reviewing attorney. 

**Assumed Knowledge**: Ability to Operate a Computer, Ability to Use Email Software, Knowledge of Mircrosoft Excel, Knowledge of USCIS website, Knowledge of Employment-Based Petitions Requirements, Knowledge of your Firm's Case Management Software (INSZoom, LollyLaw, Filevine,etc.)

#### **Required Documents for Labor Condition Application (LCA)**
The documents you will need for this application are: 
* Current Name, Address, HR Representative, and Proposed Work Location of Client's Sponsored Company
* Proposed Wage, Job Title, and Job Description of Client

   **Note**: If the client will be working at a secondary work location in addition to the first proposed work location, be sure to include that address in the application. 


### **Determining the Correct Wage Range**
Finding the correct wage range enables you to have the necessary information to complete the Labor Condition Application in later steps
1. Go to the Department of Labor Website located [here](https://flag.dol.gov/programs/LCA)
2. Navigate to the **Wage Data** tab
3. Click **OFLC Wage Search**
4. Fill out the fields with the information from your collected required documents

    **NOTE**: Select **All Industries** as your collection unless the sponsoring company is in the field of higher education (ACWIA).

    **NOTE**: If unsure about the O-Net occupation code, search within the O-Net occupation code search bar to find a job title/code matching the proposed job title of client.

5. Once you have a range of wage levels, prepare to determine the exact correct wage level in the next step below


### **Finding the Correct Wage Level**
This step can vary by law firm on methodology to find the wage level according to USCIS standards. Here we have provided a excel spreadsheet example that aims to streamline the process to finding the correct wage level for your client in case your firm does not have a preexisting methodology for finding it. Please follow the steps below the table. 

![Wage Level Excel Spreadsheet](assets/images/screenshots/wagelevel.jpg)
*Fig 3: An  Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet Wage Calculator*
1. Determine the SVP Range
   * (a): This can be found on the same OFLC Wage Search page you used in the previous step (Determining the Correct Wage Range).
   * (b): Scroll down to the "O-Net Occupations Using This Page" section and click the number besides "Job Zone", here the SVP Range should show in a separate window.
      **NOTE**: No matter the SVP Range, you will always put a 1 in the Wage Level Result Column by default 


2. Determine the Experience Requirements 
   * (a): Input the years of experience required by both the employer and the O-Net job description. 
   * (b): If the numbers are equal then input a 0. 
   * (c): If the number of years required by the employer are higher than the years required by O-Net, you will input a number according to the numerical difference between the two.
   
     **Example**: If the employer requires 3 years and O-Net requires 1, then you would add 2 to the Wage Level Result Column.
  
       **NOTE**: You would input a 0 if the number of years O-Net required was higher than the years required by the employer.


3.  Determine the Educational Requirements 
    * (a): Input the degree required by both the employer and the O-Net job description. 
    * (b): If the degrees are equal then input a 0 (I.e. a Bachelors degree required for both employer and O-Net standards).
    * (c): If the degree required by the employer is higher than the degree required by O-Net, you will input a number according to the difference between the two. 
  
        **Example**: If the employer requires a Masters degree and O-Net requires a Bachelors degree, then you would add 1 to the Wage Level Result Column.


       **NOTE**: You would input a 0 if the degree required by O-Net was higher than the years required by the employer.

4. Determine the Special Skills Requirements 
   * (a):  Carefully review the employers job description and the O-Net job description for the client.
   * (b): If there are any technical or specialized soft skills required by the employers job description that is not on the O-Net job description then add a 1 in the Wage Level Result column.
  
      **NOTE**: The number you input into the Wage Result Column should never be above 1 for this section.

5. Determine the Supervisory Duties Requirements 
   * (a):  Carefully review the employers job description and the O-Net job description for the client.
   * (b): If the number of employees that are overseen by the proposed client detailed on the employers job description is above the number of employees defined in the O-Net job description then add a 1 in the Wage Level Result column.
  
      **NOTE**: The number you input into the Wage Result Column should never be above 1 for this section.
  
      **NOTE**: If the positions title already includes the word "manager" then do not add a number and simply input a 0. This is due to the expectation that managers will be inherently overseeing employees.

6. Calculating Sum of the Wage Level Result Column
   * (a): Add the numbers in the Wage Level Result Column together. 
   * (b): Refer back to your wage level range obtained in the previous step and select the corresponding wage level to determine correct prevailing wage.
   * (b): Prepare to use this wage level information in the formal Labor Condition Application steps below.
