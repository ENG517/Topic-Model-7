## User Scenario  1: 

A legal assistant who has been working at an immigration law firm for six months has been primarily helping compile information for employment-based petitions. Recently, they have also been trusted with a crucial part of the process that helps establish a living wage the employer must pay to the sponsoring client so that they are being compensated appropriately for their employment. This document is known as a LCA (Labor Condition Application) and is submitted by a head attorney but can be drafted by a junior assistant. This step is not very complex but the form is located on a new website that requires a login and a new fillable form interface using hyperlinks to other websites that help the user understand what wage is appropriate for the worker based on degree, years of experience, and special skills.

#### How our Maps Help the User:

These maps look to tackle a more complex function of a H-1B petition. The LCA or labor condition application looks to establish what is the wage an employer has to pay an incoming foreign worker coming into the U.S. on the larger H-1B application. These maps help establish two main functions of the LCA itself; collecting data for the application and filing the actual application form for the LCA on the Department of Labor website. This can be seen by the LCA data collection map and the LCA application map, both having examples of conditional processing alternative maps for advanced and new users, these maps can be seen in our output folder. 

## User Scenario 2: 

A legal assistant who has been working at an immigration law firm for three months has been helping create employment-based immigration petitions like the H-1B visa. A H-1B visa is part of the I-129 employment-based petition and requires different documents, forms, and clients that the legal assistant must interact with now. They are familiar with the USCIS website, the workflow of compiling a petition and contacting clients for required information. They are confident in their ability to manage this case but still need advice on specific tasks like how to craft a company support letter since that is not a requirement in family-based petitions. In addition to creating a H-1B visa, they have also been trusted to collect data for the LCA application but not fill out the form.

#### How Our Maps Help the User:

These maps help this user scenario by combining the process of completing the H-1B petition and also the process of completing the LCA application. The LCA is within the H-1B petition but depending on the level of user you are, may be responsible for a different level of completion of the overall H-1B petition. These new and advanced user maps aim to help this level of completion difference and make clear maps that help determine different workflow paths depending on your role. The advanced role has fewer steps and concepts due to the assumption that the advanced user will be more familiar with the core websites and auxiliary information needed, whereas the new user needs a crash course in every aspect of the buildup to filing a H-1B petition with a LCA attached to it.

## User Scenario 3: 

A new legal assistant has just been hired by an immigration law firm. They have an undergraduate education in the humanities and have undertaken positions that require great amounts of reading and writing in the past. They do not have experience in legal studies but have experience in following complex processes at their previous company. They have been tasked with drafting their first H-1B petition packet for a client coming from Norway who has been sponsored by an international automotive company wishing to have an employee work at one of their U.S. automotive factories. They have been told what a H-1B petition does and why it exists but have not been clearly told why an H-1B petition is the required petition in this specific scenario context. Additionally, they have been told what types of documents are needed but have been instructed to look at the firm's past petitions of this type to see what specific documents are required, but they are unsure of whether they should use the document types they find in other petitions due to the dated nature of the last petition. They also have been instructed to look at the USCIS website to find current form editions and physical addresses for USCIS field offices to send the petition to after the petition draft has been approved, but the website is vast in content. They are not required to manage the entire case from start to finish but, there is an expectation that they will produce a good first draft and compile the correct documents needed so that a more senior employee can file it themselves.

#### How Our Maps Help the User: 
The audience for this map is a novice user who needs high level information presented to them so that they can get started on their task. An H-1B petition is the first and most important information for the user to receive which is why it is at the beginning of both map variations. These maps begin the steps to collect the required information to proceed with the H-1B petition and go into further detail on auxiliary information or resources that will be used during the creation of the petition. This is especially important due to the varied nature that many applications are completed in law firms but still have to meet a final regulatory standard. 

In Map 2:Scenario 2, the reference task of required documents is listed second because the user scenario specifies the importance of the novice user having a list of required documentation available to them. Following is another reference topic with the idea that having the two reference topics together and close to the top of the map would provide a pseudo-cheatsheet element for the user. This was an intentional design choice made to convenience a novice user. 

On the contents of both maps as a whole, the decision was made to keep the maps small and focused, auxiliary information is less helpful and more confusing to novice users who do not have the skills or context to parse the information. Therefore, some of the topics with the finer details were excluded from this scenarioâ€™s maps.
